welcome to adventure!! would you like instructions?
yes

somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again. magic is said to work in the cave. i will be your eyes and hands. direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words. i should warn you that i look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north". should you get stuck, type "help" for some general hints. for information on how to end your adventure, etc., type "info".


this program was originally developed by will crowther. most of the features of the current program were added by don woods. address complaints about the unix version to jim gillogly jim@rand.org

you are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. around you is a forest. a small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.

enter
you are inside a building, a well house for a large spring. there are some keys on the ground here. there is a shiny brass lamp nearby. there is food here. there is a bottle of water here.

get keys
ok

get lamp
ok

exit
you're at end of road again.

south
you are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a rocky bed.

south
at your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit in the rock. downstream the streambed is bare rock.

south
you are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt. set into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete. a dry streambed leads into the depression. the grate is locked.

open grate
the grate is now unlocked.

down
you are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface. a low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west. the grate is open.

west
you are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. there is a dim light at the east end of the passage. there is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.

west
it is now pitch dark. if you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.

lamp on
your lamp is now on. you are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. a low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west. a note on the wall says "magic word xyzzy". a three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.

xyzzy
you're inside building. you're inside building. there is food here. there is a bottle of water here.

quit
do you really want to quit now?
yes
ok
you scored 27 out of a possible 350 using 14 turns. you are obviously a rank amateur. better luck next time. to achieve the next higher rating, you need 9 more points.
okay, you get the idea...

in order to win the game, you cannot ask for instructions, nor can you enter the cave by the riverbed and opening the grate. the next round will be a complete game, played until the win. it will also be annotated. anything in regular text is what the computer prints out. anything italicized is what i have typed. anything in bold is an annotation. i could have put one annotation in the introduction game... in order to open the grate, you must have the keys with you. otherwise you will not be able to unlock the grate.
a complete game, annotated

sw
you are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both directions.

up

west
you're at junction with warm walls.

you don't have to take the following side trip, but the view of the volcano is nice.

north
you are on the edge of a breath-taking view. far below you is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out, cascading back down into the depths. the glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every- thing an eerie, macabre appearance. the air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. the walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds. embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls. to one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself. an immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left. to the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. the far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene. a dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.

south
you're at junction with warm walls.

south
you're at fork in path.

you are inside a barren room. the center of the room is completely empty except for some dust. marks in the dust lead away toward the far end of the room. the only exit is the way you came in. there is a ferocious cave bear eying you from the far end of the room! the bear is locked to the wall with a golden chain!

feed bear
the bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.

unlock chain
the chain is now unlocked.

" a burly troll stands by the bridge and insists you throw him a treasure before you may cross.

throw bear
the bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and scurries away. the bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.

do not take the bear with you across the bridge. the bridge will collapse under the weight of the bear, and you will die.

you will need the trident to open the "clam."

you are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the giant room. it appears to be a repository for the "adventure" program. massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light. scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles all of them empty
, a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns. off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly. a sign nearby reads: "do not disturb the dwarves!" an immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

it's end game. if you don't do exactly as i have done, you will either blow yourself up or wake up the dwarves and get killed.

you are at the southwest end of the repository. to one side is a pit full of fierce green snakes. on the other side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird. in one corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. a large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor. a vast mirror stretches off to the northeast. at your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "treasure vault. keys in main office." the grate is locked.

all of adventuredom gives tribute to you, adventurer grandmaster! to achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!

comments about the mazes...

there are two mazes in this cave; we saw only one. the maze with passages all different leads to a vending machine where more oil can be purchased for your lamp. if you do this, you cannot win the game. then again, if you run out of oil, you will fall into a pit and die that much sooner.

if you look carefully at the descriptions of the rooms in the "all different" maze, you will see each description is slightly different.
you are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
you are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
you are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.

you are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
the vending machine is south off of little maze of twisting passages. the exit is down from maze of twisty little passages. you can figure out the rest.

the maze where all of the passages are alike is a lot more challenging to navigate. to map it, you must make the rooms different by dropping things in them. if you drop treasures, you risk having the pirate steal them, so best to drop things that aren't treasures. to map all the rooms, you will have to make several trips into the maze with more armloads of stuff. of course, why should you bother? i've already given you the most direct route through the maze. and, yes, i have fully mapped both mazes. it's a great time sink.



you are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
around you is a forest.  a small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

you are at witt's end.  passages lead off in *all* directions.


    mirror canyon

you are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  the floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  the walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  the mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.
  a
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.


    breath-taking view

you are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  the glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  the air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  the walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  to one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  an immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  to
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  the far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  a dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.

winding passage
this is a winding passage. it seems that there are only exits on the east and north.

cave
this is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark, forbidding staircase leading down.

entrance to hades
you are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

  abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

the gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled bodies in one corner. thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.
[the way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.]
south
 some invisible force prevents you from passing through the gate.

ring bell
 the bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. the wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face you. on their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror takes shape. in your confusion, the candles drop to the ground and they are out
.
wait too long
 the tension of this ceremony is broken, and the wraiths, amused but shaken at your clumsy attempt, resume their hideous jeering.
light candles with match
 the flames flicker wildly and appear to dance. the earth beneath your feet trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you. the spirits cower at your unearthly power.
read book
 each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening confusion. as the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding, speaks: "begone, fiends!" a heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.

the gate is protected by an invisible force. it makes your teeth ache to touch it.
land of the dead
you have entered the land of the living dead. thousands of lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. in the corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. a passage exits to the north.
crystal skull

 a force keeps you from taking the bodies.
engravings cave
you have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.
engravings there are old engravings on the walls here.

read engravings

the engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by an unknown hand. they depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the ancient zorkers. skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs are excerpts illustrating the major religious tenets of that time. unfortunately, a later age seems to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.

what is the significance of all the engravings?
      the knowledgeable critic, i. q. roundhead, wrote a ten-volume study of the engravings of the ancient zorkers. to make a long story short, he concluded that the zorkers were very strange people.
dome room
you are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.

brass bell
read inscription
 
the prayer is inscribed in an ancient script, rarely used today. it seems to be a philippic against small insects, absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects. the final verse consigns trespassers to the land of the dead. all evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient zorkers were obscure.
egyptian room
this is a room which looks like an egyptian tomb. there is an ascending staircase to the west.

 from the distance the sound of a lone trumpet is heard. the room becomes very bright and you feel disembodied. in a moment, the brightness fades and you find yourself rising as if from a long sleep, deep in the woods. in the distance you can faintly hear a songbird and the sounds of the forest.
north-south passage
this is a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.

loud room
this is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground. there is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward. the room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. the sound seems to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.
/the room is eerie in its quietness.
/ it is unbearably loud here, with an ear-splitting roar seeming to come from all around you. there is a pounding in your head which won't stop. with a tremendous effort, you scramble out of the room.

damp cave
this cave has exits to the west and east, and narrows to a crack toward the south. the earth is particularly damp here.
south
 it is too narrow for most insects.
stream view
you are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream. the path follows the stream, which flows from west to east.
west
 the stream emerges from a spot too small for you to enter.

you can't swim in the stream.
the other side is a sheer rock cliff.
stream
you are on the gently flowing stream. the upstream route is too narrow to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting walls. there is a narrow beach to land on.
west
 the channel is too narrow.
reservoir south
you are in a long room on the south shore of a large lake, far too deep and wide for crossing. 
[you are in a long room. to the north is a large lake, too deep to cross. you notice, however, that the water level appears to be dropping at a rapid rate. before long, it might be possible to cross to the other side from here.]
[you are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a lake. however, with the water level lowered, there is merely a wide stream running through the center of the room.]

if on boat after full
 the rising water carries the boat over the dam, down the river, and over the falls. tsk, tsk.
if in while filling
 you are lifted up by the rising river! you try to swim, but the currents are too strong. you come closer, closer to the awesome structure of flood control dam #3. the dam beckons to you. the roar of the water nearly deafens you, but you remain conscious as you tumble over the dam toward your certain doom among the rocks at its base.
reservoir north
you are in a large cavernous room, north of a large lake
[you are in a large cavernous room, the south of which was formerly a lake. however, with the water level lowered, there is merely a wide stream running through there.]

the sluice gates on the dam are closed. behind the dam, there can be seen a wide reservoir. water is pouring over the top of the now abandoned dam.

the sluice gates are closed. the water level in the reservoir is quite low, but the level is rising quickly.

the sluice gates are open, and water rushes through the dam. the water level behind the dam is still high.

dam base
you are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you and to the north. the river frigid is flowing by here. along the river are the white cliffs which seem to form giant walls stretching from north to south along the shores of the river as it winds its way downstream.

 you can land either to the east or the west.
swimming?
 you splash around for a while, fighting the current, then you drown.
frigid river 4

the river is running faster here and the sound ahead appears to be that of rushing water. on the east shore is a sandy beach. a small area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs on the west shore.

troll 
a nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.

[an unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor. all passages out of the room are open.]

a troll is here.

?
a pathetically babbling troll is here.
talk to troll
 the troll isn't much of a conversationalist.
the troll, angered and humiliated, recovers his weapon. he appears to have an axe to grind with you.
the troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in the guttural tongue of the trolls.
the troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
the troll scratches his head in confusion, then takes the axe.
you would have to get the x first, and that seems unlikely.
the troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the x
the troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
 and eats it hungrily. poor troll, he dies from an internal hemorrhage and his carcass disappears in a sinister black fog.
 and, being for the moment sated, throws it back. fortunately, the troll has poor control, and the 
 falls to the floor. he does not look pleased.
 and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
take troll
 the troll spits in your face, grunting "better luck next time" in a rather barbarous accent.
the troll laughs at your puny gesture.
every so often the troll says something, probably uncomplimentary, in his guttural tongue.
unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.

thief

there is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall. he is armed with a deadly stiletto.

the thief is a slippery character with beady eyes that flit back and forth. he carries, along with an unmistakable arrogance, a large bag over his shoulder and a vicious stiletto, whose blade is aimed menacingly in your direction. i'd watch out if i were you.
someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the walls here. he does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
you feel a light finger-touch, and turning, notice a grinning figure holding a large bag in one hand and a stiletto in the other.
your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps. with a rueful nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
the holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted. fortunately, he took nothing.
a seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through the room. on the way through, he quietly abstracted some valuables from the room and from your possession, mumbling something about "doing unto others before..."
the thief just left, still carrying his large bag. you may not have noticed that he robbed you blind first.

the thief, finding nothing of value, left disgusted.
the thief seems to have left you in the dark.
you hear, off in the distance, someone saying "my, i wonder what this fine x is doing here."
the thief is a strong, silent type.
the thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge your greeting with his usual graciousness.
you evidently frightened the robber, though you didn't hit him. he flees x, but the contents of his bag fall on the floor."
throw knife
 you missed. the thief makes no attempt to take the knife, though it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag. he does seem angered by your attempt.
your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
give object
 the thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity, but accepts the x and stops to admire its beauty.
the thief places the x in his bag and thanks you politely.
take
 once you got him, what would you do with him?
 listen to
 the thief says nothing, as you have not been formally introduced."
the robber, somewhat surprised at this turn of events, nimbly retrieves his  stiletto.
the robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and, when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
the robber, rummaging through his bag, dropped a few items he found valueless.
you suddenly notice that the obj vanished.

you hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
the thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.
as the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his treasures reappear:
the chalice is now safe to take.

his booty remains.

fcd#3 was constructed in year 783 of the great underground empire to harness
the mighty frigid river. this work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant lord dimwit flathead the excessive.
this impressive structure is composed of 370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256
feet tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top. the lake created behind
the dam has a volume of 1.7 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square
feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

the map shows a forest with three clearings. the largest clearing contains a house. three paths leave the large clearing. one of these paths, leading southwest, is marked "to stone barrow".

   1. what have you tried to throw into the river?
   2. there is no river god. anything thrown in is lost forever.

which object is best for casting images?
   1. what are you talking about?
inside the barrow
you are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. the barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. you can see a faint glow at the far end.
lamp
sword
leave
 you may not recall, but when you entered, the door of the barrow shut behind you. there is no way out.
narrow tunnel
you are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. the cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. a deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. the walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. a foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.
down
 as you start down, you slip on the crumbling rocks and pull back, narrowly averting a fatal fall.
take moss
 some of the moss rubs off on you, but it stops glowing very quickly  once plucked from its environment.
foot bridge
you are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. the path runs north and south from here.
down
 the drop would be fatal.
great cavern
this is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. the room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. a narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast.
take moss
 some of the moss rubs off on you, but it stops glowing very quickly  once plucked from its environment.
take stalactities
 the only ones you can reach are too large to successfully break off.
shallow ford
you are at the southern edge of a great cavern. to the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. to the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. dim light illuminates the cavern.

dark tunnel
this is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. the tunnel is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a narrower one leading southeast.

north end of garden
this is the northern end of a formal garden. hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. the light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. a break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. a carefully manicured path leads south. in the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. it appears to be a gazebo.
[there is a beautiful unicorn here cropping grass.]

take rose
 you prick your finger trying to take a rose, and jump back annoyed. the rose almost seemed to move its thorns into your path.
gazebo
this is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. it is cool and restful here. a tea table adorns the center of the gazebo.
sitting on the table is:
matchbook
china teapot

formal garden
this is the middle part of a formal garden. hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. the path is of small crushed white stones. it winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. to the north a small structure can be seen. to the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. there is a small gap in the hedges to the west.

topiary
this is the southern end of a formal garden. hedges hide the cavern walls and mosses provide dim illumination. fantastically shaped hedges and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. they have not recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the bushes: there is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human figures. on the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.
look at hedges
 the hedges are shaped like various animals: dogs, serpents, dragons, and the like, and they are vaguely troubling to look at.
wait
 you look around, and strangely, the topiary animals seem to have changed position slightly.
wait
 the topiary animals seem to close in on you. you turn and they are very close. they seem to be leering at you.
wait
 the topiary animals attack! you are crushed by their branches and clawed by their thorns.
path near stream
the path follows the south edge of a deep ravine and heads northeast. a tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. a faint whirring sound can be heard in that direction. on the east is a ruined archway choked with vegetation.
down
 the ravine is extremely deep. you would never make it.
carousel room
you are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom. eight identical passages leave the room.
a loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of disoriented in here.
[dented steel box] there is a dented steel box here.
 [fancy violin]
feeling dizzy, you pick a direction at random.
you're not sure which direction is which. this room is very disorienting.

open box
 opening the box reveals a fancy violin.
riddle room
this is a room which is bare on all sides. there is an exit down in the northwest corner of the room. to the east is a great closed[open] door made of stone. above the stone, the following words are written: "no man shall pass this door without solving this riddle:

  what is tall as a house,
    round as a cup,
      and all the king's horses
        can't draw it up?

group of wooden posts
northwest/west
 a great chasm blocks your way.

you are in the kitchen of the white house. a table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. a passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. a dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.
on the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
a bottle is sitting on the table.
the glass bottle contains:
  a quantity of water
go west
living room
you are in the living room. there is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
a battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.
take lamp

fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.
take painting
taken.
go north
studio
this appears to have been an artist's studio. the walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here. at the south end of the room is an open door (also covered with paint). a dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.
loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
go north
the troll room
this is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
a nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
the troll's mighty blow drops you to your knees.
kill troll with sword
you are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is ineffective.
the troll's axe barely misses your ear.
kill troll with sword
clang! crash! the troll parries.
the troll's axe barely misses your ear.
kill troll with sword
the troll is confused and can't fight back.
the troll slowly regains his feet.
kill troll with sword
the troll is knocked out!
kill troll with sword
the unarmed troll cannot defend himself: he dies.
almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
your sword is no longer glowing.
drop sword
dropped.

torch room
this is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. above you is a large dome. up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. in the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.
a piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.
sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.
go south
temple
this is the north end of a large temple. on the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. below the prayer is a staircase leading down. the west wall is solid granite. the exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.

canyon view
you are at the top of the great canyon on its west wall. from here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the frigid river upstream. across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the flathead mountains to the east. following the canyon upstream to the north, aragain falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. the mighty frigid river flows out from a great dark cavern. to the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. a path leads northwest. it is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
go down
rocky ledge
you are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. you can see from here that the main flow from aragain falls twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. below you is the canyon bottom. above you is more cliff, which appears climbable.
go down
canyon bottom
you are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. the lesser part of the runoff of aragain falls flows by below. to the north is a narrow path.
go north
end of rainbow
you are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the frigid river past the falls. the beach is narrow due to the presence of the white cliffs. the river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. a rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.

loud room
this is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground. there is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward. the room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. the sound seems to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.
on the ground is a large platinum bar.
it is unbearably loud here, with an ear-splitting roar seeming to come from all around you. there is a pounding in your head which won't stop. with a tremendous effort, you scramble out of the room.

entrance to hades
you are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed
  abandon every hope all ye who enter here!
the gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled bodies in one corner. thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.
the way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.
ring bell
the bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. the wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face you. on their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror takes shape.
in your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).
take candles
taken.
light match
one of the matches starts to burn.
light candles with match
the candles are lit.
the flames flicker wildly and appear to dance. the earth beneath your feet trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you. the spirits cower at your unearthly power.
the match has gone out.
read book
each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening confusion. as the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding, speaks: "begone, fiends!" a heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.
drop book
dropped.
go south
land of the dead
you have entered the land of the living dead. thousands of lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. in the corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. a passage exits to the north.

this room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
a cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase. from his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.

"thanks, chum."  the drunk reaches into his tattered cloak.  "here, take this
magic scroll.  i used to be a magic user, but i couldn't make the grade.
hope you'll have more luck than me."  he hands you the scroll.
read it
the scroll reads "bozbar spell:  cause an animal to sprout wings."
"another pint of ale!" cries the drunk, flipping the silver coin to the
bartender.
gnusto the bozbar spell
your spell book begins to glow softly.  slowly, ornately, the words of the 
bozbar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself.
the book's brightness fades, but the spell remains!  however, the scroll
on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.
drunk, where is the warlock?
"he lives in the castle beyond the wide chasm to the south.  at least, that's
what i've heard."  he looks about furtively, a great fear blazing in his
eyes.

the road winds here, leading northeast and southeast.  a seedy tavern lies to
the west.  there is a pile of oats here.
take pile of oats
you can't reach them from the horse!
steer horse south
using the reins, you bring the horse about to face the south.
kick the horse
the horse is too well trained to gallop off the road into the thick woods.  
it rears back on its hind legs, whinnying in confusion.
steer horse southeast
using the reins, you bring the horse about to face the southeast.
kick hose
you can't see any hose here.

the road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and 
the northwest.
steer horse south
the horse turns southward, still traveling at a brisk trot.  a new section
of road comes into view...
edge of chasm, on the horse.
the road ends suddenly at a wide chasm.  the road leads upward to the north, 
and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.  lying in a 
tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.
horse, whoa
the horse pulls to a stop, scant feet from the edge of the chasm!

horse.
cast the urbzig spell on the snake
the snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.
bozbar the horse
a pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful
shoulders.  the horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on
its face.
kick the horse
the horse gallops toward the chasm and over the edge!  it begins
plummeting into the chasm, toward sharp rocks below!  then, slowly at first
but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful
wings.  you rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully 
across the chasm.  the horse lands gently of the far side, resuming
its brisk trot...
road to castle, on the horse.
you are at the southern edge of a wide chasm.  a road leads southward 
toward a castle of black stone.

the horse continues trotting briskly along the road...
edge of moat, on the horse.
the black castle looms on the other side of the moat.  the drawbridge is
closed, and the moat looks unswimmable.
a green plant is growing near the edge of the moat.  
a red plant is growing near the edge of the moat.
the horse, sensing the evil ahead, halts at the moat and snorts wildly.
get off the horse
you are now on your own feet.

the pouch has some writing on it and is currently closed.

you can't read a quantity of magic dust!
read the pouch
the pouch reads "magic dust:  world's most potent fertilizer."
examine plant
which plant do you mean, the green plant or the red plant?
green
it looks like a barnibus viltus, a simple and harmless vine.  
it appears to be newly sprouted.
sprinkle magic dust on the green plant
the green plant begins growing at a tremendous rate, shooting long
grasping tendrils across the moat, and growing right up the side of
the castle. the plant has now become a living bridge, which you can
climb up to cross the moat.
examine the red plant
it looks like a speciman of flombus digestus, the dangerous man-eating
plant.  fortunately, this is a very tiny specimen.
sprinkle magic dust on the red plant
the red plant begins growing at a tremendous rate.  it sprouts giant red
pods, large enough to engulf you!
(they do so.)
                 *** you have died ***
you awake to see haffibar, the guild physician, bending over you.  "you'd
better be more careful," she admonishes.  "this is the second time you've
gotten killed.  i overheard some members of the circle say that if
you die once more, they won't waste another magic spell reviving you."  you
slip back into unconsciousness again, and when you awake you find yourself
outdoors...

go north
road near bridge
a small wooden bridge to the west spans the brook and leads (you can see)
to sunny, open pastures, where birds sing and swoop playfully.  a wide road
leading south runs parallel with the brook and disappears into the dark
shadows.  an impenetrable forest lies to the east, and north of here is
a marsh.
on the far side of the bridge is a troll, either dead or sleeping.
guarding the bridge here is a buck-toothed cyclops wielding a mace.  he 
scowls as you approach.
west
the cyclops roars at you, swings his mace, and tries to bite you.  you jump
out of the way.

the cyclops spits out a horrible assortment of syllables that you barely
decipher as a demand for all your valuables.

the gnusto spell is yours forever.  other than that, you have the
urbzig spell committed to memory once and the frotz spell committed to 
memory once.
the cyclops raises his mace above his head and leans back, preparing to leap
at you and strike you full force with the mace!
cast the urbzig spell on the cyclops
the cyclops is replaced by a moth, which flutters away.  the mace falls
to the ground.

bridge
your're standing on a small wooden bridge spanning a babbling brook.  you can
see sunny, open pastures west of here, where birds sing and swoop playfully.
as you cross the bridge, the boards creak loudly.
the troll wakes up and pulls a long nasty knife out of his shabby clothes.
he points the knife in your direction as he hisses, "gold! give me your
gold!"
memorize urbzig
urbizg spell:  using your best study habits, you commit the urbzig spell
to memory.
the troll jabs the knife in your direction, his blood-red eyes dripping
with greed.  "give me your gold, and maybe you'll live!" he hisses.
urbzig troll
you speak the words of the spell perfectly, but nothing happens!
the troll seems surprised.  "your magic fails you, eh? ha!" he adjusts his
grip on the long nasty knife and walks slowly toward you, looking for the most
vulnerable part of you throat.

you step back away from the brook.

the wide, bumpy road continues north and south here.  nestled among
the thick forest foliage is a stone building with a closed black door and
no windows.  above the door is a sign.

suddenly the door opens, and you hear a voice inside say "come in, come in!"
go into the hut
as you step into the hut, the door shuts quickly behind you, leaving you in
total darkness.  you can't see a thing.
darkness
a voice in the dark mumbles something about not being able to find a match.
frotz the spell book
there is an almost blinding flash of light as the spell book begins to glow!
it slowly fades to a less painful level, but the spell book is now quite 
usable as a light source.
gornforb's grocery
you're standing in a nearly empty store.  a closed black door leads west. 
several empty glass jars, an empty bag, and a pencil are all you see on the
dusty shelves.
gornforb, the storekeeper, continues to look in all the empty jars.  "i 
think there's a match in here somewhere."
take the empty bag
"no, no," say gornforb.  "no bag unless you buy something."  gornforb looks
about and picks up the pencil.  "here.  this will cost you 100 gold 
nuggets."
offer 1 gold nugget
"2 gold nuggets, and not a zorkmid cheaper!"  says gornforb sternly.
buy the pencil
gornforb takes 2 gold nuggets from you, hands you the pencil, and opens
the door.  "thank you, come again, come again."
gornforb, give me the paper bag
"help yourself, take it if you want it, thank you, come again, come again."
he stands by the door, impatiently waiting for you to leave.
take the bag
taken.
"good day, good day," says gornforb impatiently.

bridge 
as you cross the bridge, the boards creak loudly.  the troll hears you
coming and quickly puts his long nasty knife to your throat.  "this time
you shall not live!"
show the bag to the troll
the troll's blood-red eyes bulge disgustingly when he sees the word
"gold" on the bag.  he drops his knife and reaches for the bag.
put the bag into the brook
"gold!" shrieks the troll with pleasure, as he dives into the brook after
the bag.  suddenly you hear another shriek, this time of agony; some 
thrashing in the water below you; and then all is quiet, save for the singing
of the birds to the west.
go west
greener pastures, near the bridge
this is the edge of one of the most idyllic spots in the land.  rare and
beautiful birds quickly encircle you, sensing no maliciousness in your
heart.

you can hear your mother calling you, and your brothers, sisters
and father to lunch.

you're standing by the southern side of berube pond.  you can ascend
sunny hill to the south, go to old mr. langosy's raspberry patch to
the west or follow a path to your family's farmhouse to the east.
  the platypus crawls into a semi-hidden pit and disappears.

it's as dark as a new-moon night in the pit.  you can see only a few
feet down, but not the bottom of the pit.

you jump feet-first into the pit, and fall a few feet...
...and fall some more...
...and some more...
...and some more...
and finally land with a slight "thud."
pit bottom
you're standing in a small round room.  a long dark passage above
you disappears into black nothingness.  in a corner of the room is
a square glass-topped table, and in the south wall is a tiny door,
not more than 12 inches tall.
open the door
the door is locked.
push the door
the door won't budge.
look at the table
the table is about 3 feet tall, with spindly wooden legs and a clear
glass top.  on the table is a white mushroom with a label attached.

the label says "eat me."
smell the mushroom
it smells just like a white mushroom.
eat the mushroom
[taking the white mushroom first]
despite warnings from ... from someone (your sister? your mother?) 
about eating unfamiliar fungi, you take a tentative bite from the
mushroom.  the you notice that the table is growing larger and 
larger still.  the white mushroom you're carrying gets heavier
and heavier, and you notice that it too is growing.  the door in the
south wall grows in height, and the room itself seems to expand in
every direction.  suddenly, everything stops growing (or perhaps
you stop shrinking).  you notice that the door (which is now 
taller than you) has a keyhole.
look through the kethole
[i don't know the word "kethole."]
oops keyhole
through the keyhole, you can see a lovely garden on the other side
of the door. platypuses cavort happily on the lawns and in the
pools.
knock on the door
still peering through the keyhole, you see a smiling platypus
wearing a party hat waddle over to the door.
"hello," it says cheerfully.
platypus, open the door
"the key is on the table."  the platypus waddles away from the door.
look at the table
the table looms over you like everest over hillary.  way overhead, 
you see a key through the glass, which you're sure wasn't there
before.
take the key
the key is far out of reach.
climb the table
don't let the sir hillary analogy get to your head.  the legs of
the table are too smooth and slippery.
look around
pit bottom
you're standing in a small round room.  a long dark passage above
you disappears into black nothingness.  in a corner of the room is
a square glass-topped table, which looms over you like goliath 
over david.  way overhead, you see a key through the glass.  in 
the south wall is a closed door.  in the shadows of another corner 
is a black mushroom.
take the black mushroom then eat it
taken.
you take a timorous taste of the black mushroom.  then you notice 
that the table is growing smaller, and smaller still.  the mushrooms
you're carrying get lighter and lighter, and you notice that they
too are shrinking.  the door in the south wall gets tinier and 
tinier, and the room itself seems to contract in every direction.  
suddenly, everything stops shrinking (or perhaps you stop growing).
take the key
taken.
eat the mushroom
[which mushroom do you mean, the white mushroom or the black 
mushroom?]
white
you take a confident chomp from the white mushroom.  as expected,
the table grows larger, the mushrooms get heavier, the door in the
south wall grows, and the room itself expands in every direction.
eventually, everything stops growing (or perhaps you stop 
shrinking).
unlock the door with the key then open the door
okay, the door is now unlocked.
you swing open the door.
go in
